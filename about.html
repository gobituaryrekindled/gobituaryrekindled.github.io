        <p><b>GoBituary Rekindled: Cultivating connection with local history through an interactive monument</b> was created as a Spring 2025 University of California, Berkeley Master's of Information Management and Systems final capstone project.</p>
        <p>We would like to acknowledge our faculty advisor, Coye Cheshire, who provided invaluable guidance throughout the project, and even got in the weeds with us by cutting the wood for the final prototype!

        <p>We would like to thank local historian Dennis Evanosky who provided great guidance and information for the historical component of this project, and Caroline Nickersonn, who also reviewed the project’s content. Finally, we would like to thank Nicolas Betancur for his guidance and assistance with the project’s woodworking and technical components.</p>
